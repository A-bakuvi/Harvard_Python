# A Quiz and a Game

Hello, today I will talk about my project which is a quiz and a game at the same time so you will need both brains and luck :smile:

## My Projects Description

### 1. Rock-Paper-Scissors (The Game Part)

My project starts as a simple rock-paper-scissors game. When you first hit play it briefly talks about what the game is and then asks for an input of rock, paper, or scissors. If you write anything else it will tell you that you didn't write rock, paper or scissors and then it will exit the program. If you enter the correct inputs then you play with the computer until one of you reaches 3 points (every time you win you get 1 point and every time the computer wins the computer gets 1 point). if you lose it will print a stegosaurus that says "You lost, try again" and then asks if you want to play again. if you hit yes then it starts all over again. if you hit no then it will say "Well thank you for playing, see you later!". However if you win though it will show a dragon that will say " Great job, you won against the computer, now time for the quiz! " and start a quiz. 

### 2. Quiz (The Brains Part)

The quiz part is the part where you are asked 10 questions. The questions are about planets in our solar system. If you know 8 or more right you win the game and a trex pops out and says "Arggh! Congratulations, you have won the game!!! ". However if you know 8 or less then it shows a demon saying "You answered (the number of questions you answered correct) questions correct but you needed 8 to pass" and then asks whether or not you want to try again. then if you say yes then you try again and if you say no it says "Well thank you for playing, see you later!"

### 3. test_project.py

test_project.py is the part which I test the code I wrote. I implemented 2 functions in which the first one I tested if my game was checking for misspellings or was case-sensitive. In the second function I checked if it was showing the scores of the player and computer correct.

### 4. requirements.txt

this is a simple file in which I stored all of the pip-installable libraries I used during the game.
